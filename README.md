🔧 Tech Stack
HTML – Structure of the music player

CSS – Styling, layout, and responsiveness

JavaScript – Interactivity and audio control using HTML5 Audio API.


🛠️ How It Works
A list of song objects contains metadata like song title, file path, and duration.

When the user clicks a song or uses control buttons, the corresponding audio file is loaded and played using JavaScript.

The current playback is reflected via the progress bar and updated dynamically.

The active song gets highlighted with a pause icon.
